# A Dungeon Crawler by What.exe

#### For CS 2340

JDK should be at least version 11. JavaFX is automatically included through gradle for compile and run times :)

This project is modular! This means that a functioning distribution with a launcher can be created with `gradlew jlink` and will be located at *build/image*, which can be run with either `"What.exe Dungeon Crawler"` or `"What.exe Dungeon Crawler.bat"` in a terminal.

Alternatively, the project can be run with `gradlew run` or by creating an Application Run Configuration in IntelliJ.

Depending on IntelliJ version, JUnit tests may fail if run with `gradlew test` because of a bug. This can be circumvented in the settings at *File | Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Build Tools | Gradle | Run tests using:* to IntelliJ.
