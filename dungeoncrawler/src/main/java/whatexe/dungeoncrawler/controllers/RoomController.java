    TODO - For Allison and Gabe:
        - FXML root should have an FXID and reference in the Controller code so that entities can
            be spawned in it after construction.
            There are alternatives, as long as Nodes can be added to the Scene from this Controller.
        - If desired, override the setState(Map) method to allow for enemies to be spawned in.
            This avoids the need for casting.
            Hint: an array of Enemies can be encoded as a value in the Map.
